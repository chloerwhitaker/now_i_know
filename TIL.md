        1. "If you can't solve the problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it." - Polya
        2. If someone is programming, then they have already found a solution and are just making it happen now - logic and planning comes first.
        3. Blow off what you can at first, and add back problems as you solve simpler ones. This reduces cognitive overhead.
        4. A new error message = "progress".
        5. Break problem down, build solution up.

        1. “ ‘When someone seeks,’ said Siddhartha, ‘then it easily happens that his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find nothing, to take in nothing. [...] Seeking means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal.’ ” Hermann Hesse
        2. In case statements I kept forgetting to add a comma at the end of my select line... and just in general kept messing up commas... so note to self... if you can't figure out why your SQL code isn't working... check the commas...

            - We don't always go in order (top to bottom, left to right) however. 
             - We often consume what pops out first. 
        8. Cognative visual shortcuts: 
                (examples from codeup)

                    ⇒
                    relationship from one value to the next, like time, but not categories
                    Categories arranged from Most Extreme 
                    ⇒
                    Least Extreme

                    Progression of Values
                    Distinct Colors 
                    ⇒
